\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chapter:ch4}

The implementation of the algorithms and methods is done in pure python.
The learning part is outsourced to PX and the resulting models with trained parameters are used in the aggregation.
The aggregation can be used with both numpy array, representing just weights, as well as PX Model Objects directly.

\section{Structure}
We have a Coordinator, Data and Model wrapper Class as well as several utility metohds for downloading and unpacking datasets.
General Structure is an Interface that implements basic functions for the class and can be specialized by creating a new subclass.
\section{Model Training}
For training we use the PX Library
\section{Model Aggregation}
Model Aggregation is done in python with numpy,scipy to improve runtimes of matrix-vector operations.
\section{Evaluation}
For evaluation we use accuracy and f1 score either computed in pure python or supported bei the sklearn machine learning library.
